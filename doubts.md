## what is  vite?
    - vite is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects. It consists of two major parts:
        - A dev server that serves your source files over native ES modules, with rich built-in features and astonishingly fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR).
            - HMR is a feature that updates the browser when the source code changes, without refreshing the page.
        - A build command that bundles your code with Rollup, pre-configured to output highly optimized static assets for production.
